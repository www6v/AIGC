# Advanced RAG

**What is RAG?**

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that employes the capabilities of retrieval and generative based AI models.

**What is Naive RAG?**

Naive RAG often refers to splitting documents into chunks, embedding them, and retrieving chunks based on semantic similarity search to a user question.

It's simple, but of poor overall performance.

**That's why we need Advanced RAG.**

In this tutorials (Advanced RAG), we will learn the techniques and best practices in RAG application development, that can improve the quality of the RAG.

It's crucial to the success of a RAG application.
